Appointment Schedule

Descirption:

Python Program to make a barber shop appointment scheduler.allows the user to input the month, day and time given that are available. The target audience is meant for anyone looking to book an appointment for a haircut either old or new customer as it for new customers it helps eliminate having to call and try and make an appointment. Strengths is the ability to check if the date and time given are not duplicated, weakness it does not account for multiple employees allowing for people to either choose a different person or allow same dates for appointment. A way to improve is to create a list of employees allowing for returning customers to choose their favorite barber.
